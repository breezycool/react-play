# React Play

Adaptation of my 'Static Boilerplate' that includes React.

## Technologies
- Jade
- Foundation/Sass
- CoffeeScript
- Gulp
- BrowserSync (for auto-refresh and stats)
- Babel
- React

## Install
- `npm install`
- `bower install`

## Run
`gulp`, or `gulp serve`

## Adding Libraries
I've added jQuery and bounce.js to demonstrate how to add libraries. Just download the library using `bower install`, and then add the path to the list in the libraries task in gulpfile.js
